## About The Project

My Comic Book Guy Review is an entertaining application that displays over 200+ Simpsons episodes from a public [API](https://sampleapis.com/api-list/simpsons) that users can rate as they binge through all seasons 1-10 of The Simpsons. The user can select any episode thumbnail from the bank to view its details which includes the episode's name, season, episode number, description, popularity rating, original air date and an image from that episode. From there, they may give it a rating of: "What the hell was that?", "Meh", or "Lenny Approved!". This will then move the episode thumbnail to its corresponding module on the home view. My Comic Book Guy Review was constructed utilizing React (v5), Router, Proptypes, media breakpoints for desktop/mobile displays, and Cypress testing. It took me approximately 50 hours total to finish within a 6-day given timeframe.

## Future Extensions
- Revote after voting on a episode
- Incorporating a "Haven't Seen it" button in case the user is unable to rate the episode
- Show season and episode number on episode thumbnails on home view
- Filter home view by episode name, seaons, and/or episode number

## Reflection

- Keyanna (Kiko) Pausch: "This solo project really solidified my undrstanding of React, Router and Cypress testing. It also presented many scenarios where I could see the pros and cons of utilizing version 5 as oppose to version 6 of React. As much as version 5 is foundational for me, I believe I will utilize version 6 onwards with its unique features like classless-ness, hooks and useEffect. Lastly, I thoughly enjoyed the Cypress testing process and really felt comfortable intercepting/stubbing my tests for efficiency and less expensive network requests."
